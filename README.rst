Hypothesis for Java feasibility prototype
=========================================

This is a very rough prototype of what Hypothesis could look like in Java. It's not even
close to being production ready software. It implements the core algorithm and a very crude
API. It has only been lightly tested. It exists to prove that the concept is feasible, and it
achieves it.

It is under the AGPL. That is not intended as a long term licensing strategy but gives me
more flexibility for future plans. The most likely future licensing path is that there will
be a core version available under the MPLv2 with a proprietary extension library containing
most of the strategies and some useful extensions.

If you are interested in a fully fledged Hypothesis for Java, please
